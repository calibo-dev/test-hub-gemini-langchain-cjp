## 1. Project Overview

Based on the available code, this project is a **Python multi-agent “research → report” service** built with **LangChain** and exposed via a **FastAPI** API. It orchestrates a sequential workflow (research agent → reporting agent) to generate a markdown report file (`report.md`) from a topic input.

Primary stack:
- **Python** application using a **src/**-layout package (`latest_ai_development`)
- **LangChain** for agent orchestration, prompt construction, and model interaction
- **FastAPI + Uvicorn** for HTTP endpoints (`/health`, `/ask`)
- Optional integrations visible in code: **AWS Secrets Manager (boto3)**, **Azure Key Vault**, and LLM endpoints configured via environment variables.

### Template Origin

This project was initialized using **LangChain**.

```bash
langchain template new langgraph-agent-template
```

Conventions used (based on the available code):
- **src/ layout**: application code lives under `src/latest_ai_development/`.
- **YAML-driven configuration**: stage prompts, stage order, and primary/fallback model settings are externalized into `config/*.yaml`.
- **Generated artifacts**: `report.md` is the final markdown report produced by the two-agent orchestration.

## 4. Key Files and Configuration

- **`pyproject.toml`**  
  Declares project metadata, Python version constraints, dependencies, and console entrypoints. Incorrect edits can break installation, dependency resolution, or runtime commands.

- **`uv.lock`**  
  Stores the locked dependency graph for reproducible environments. Changing or removing it can make dependency resolution inconsistent across environments.

- **`src/latest_ai_development/main.py`**  
  Defines the FastAPI app, health endpoint, `/ask` endpoint, and CLI entry functions (`run`, `train`, `replay`, `test`, `run_with_trigger`). Incorrect edits can break API routes, server startup, or command execution.

- **`src/latest_ai_development/workflow.py`**  
  Implements the main LangChain two-agent sequential orchestration. Incorrect edits can break agent coordination, topic handoff, output saving, or markdown report generation.

- **`src/latest_ai_development/prompts/prompt_builder.py`**
  Defines prompt construction used by the researcher and reporting analyst stages. Incorrect edits can degrade output quality, break formatting expectations, or weaken stage/task alignment.

- **`src/latest_ai_development/config/workflow.yaml`**
  Defines workflow stage order and output persistence behavior.

- **`src/latest_ai_development/config/stages.yaml`**
  Defines stage prompts, instructions, tool flags, and mandatory `model.primary` plus optional `model.fallback` configuration for each stage.

- **`src/latest_ai_development/config/settings.py`**  
  Resolves runtime configuration from environment variables, including host/port, context path, output path, secret names, and config file locations.

- **`src/latest_ai_development/llm/llm_factory.py`**
  Builds LangChain chat models from each stage's `model.primary` or `model.fallback` section.

- **`src/latest_ai_development/secrets_manager.py`**  
  Provides secret resolution support for AWS Secrets Manager and Azure Key Vault. Incorrect edits can cause runtime authentication or configuration failures.

- **`src/latest_ai_development/tools/custom_tool.py`**  
  Provides a starter example for extending the system with LangChain-compatible tools. Incorrect edits can break tool argument validation or invocation behavior.

- **`Dockerfile`**  
  Defines the container build and runtime startup process. Incorrect edits can prevent the image from building or the application from starting correctly.

- **`helm_chart/Chart.yaml`**  
  Helm chart metadata. Incorrect values can break chart packaging or installation.

- **`helm_chart/values.yaml`**  
  Deployment configuration defaults. Incorrect changes can break environment-specific deployments.

- **`helm_chart/templates/*`**  
  Kubernetes manifests for deployment resources. Incorrect edits can prevent workloads, services, or ingress resources from being created correctly.

- **`Jenkinsfile`**, **`Jenkinsfile.ci`**, **`Jenkinsfile.deploy`**  
  CI/CD pipeline definitions. Incorrect edits can break build, validation, publishing, or deployment flows.

- **`AGENTS.md`**  
  Project documentation for the two-agent orchestration. Stale edits may mislead users or maintainers, though they do not directly change runtime behavior.

## 5. Setup & Installation

A typical local setup for this LangChain template looks like:

### Prerequisites

- Python in the supported range: `>=3.11,<3.13`
- `uv` for dependency management
- Stage model configuration in `src/latest_ai_development/config/stages.yaml`.
- Secret configuration for the providers referenced by stage model sections:
  - `OpenAI` with `OPENAI_API_KEY_SECRET`
  - `AnthropicAI` with `ANTHROPICAI_API_KEY_SECRET`
  - `GeminiAI` with `GEMINIAI_API_KEY_SECRET`
  - `BEDROCKAI` with `BEDROCK_AI_API_KEY_SECRET`
  - or `Ollama` with a reachable `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`

### Secret Management

- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY_SECRET` to resolve the OpenAI API key from the configured secret backend.
- Set `ANTHROPICAI_API_KEY_SECRET` to resolve the Anthropic API key from the configured secret backend.
- Set `GEMINIAI_API_KEY_SECRET` to resolve the Gemini API key from the configured secret backend.
- Set `BEDROCK_AI_API_KEY_SECRET` to resolve the AWS Bedrock API key from the configured secret backend.
- Set `CLOUD_PROVIDER=AWS` to retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
- Set `CLOUD_PROVIDER=AZURE` to retrieve secrets from Azure Key Vault.
- When using AWS, configure `AWS_REGION` as needed.
- When using Azure, configure `AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URL` and an Azure identity supported by `DefaultAzureCredential`.
- Set `TRACING_BACKEND=LANGSMITH` to enable LangSmith tracing.
- Set `LANGSMITH_API_KEY_SECRET` to resolve the LangSmith API key through the configured secret backend.
- Leave `TRACING_BACKEND` unset, or set `TRACING_BACKEND=NONE`, to run without tracing.
- Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to increase runtime logging when you need stage-level detail.

Each request/run also emits a `flow_run_id` in the API response so you can correlate a user request with the matching log lines.

### Stage Model Fallback

Every configured workflow stage must define `model.primary` in `stages.yaml`.
`model.fallback` is optional; when present, the stage builder creates a fallback
Runnable with the same prompt, parser, and tools as the primary path.

```yaml
research:
  model:
    primary:
      provider: OpenAI
      modelId: gpt-4.1-mini
      generationDefaults:
        temperature: 0.7
        topP: 0.7
        maxOutputTokens: 4000
    fallback:
      provider: OpenAI
      modelId: gpt-4.1-nano
      generationDefaults:
        temperature: 0.7
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```
**Start Server**
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python -m latest_ai_development.main
```

## 6. Development Guidelines

- **Keep orchestration logic in `workflow.py`, not in `main.py`.** `main.py` should remain a lightweight API and CLI entry layer, while `workflow.py` should own stage coordination and output generation.
- **Prefer YAML-driven changes for behavioral adjustments.** Stage prompts, stage behavior, and primary/fallback model config should be maintained in `src/latest_ai_development/config/*.yaml`. Reserve code changes for orchestration, integrations, and runtime behavior.
- **Follow the `src/` layout consistently.** Imports and local execution rely on `PYTHONPATH=src`, and this convention should remain aligned across development, testing, and containerized execution.
- **Handle generated artifacts carefully.** `report.md` is the final output produced by the reporting agent. Changing output paths, filenames, or write logic in `workflow.py` or `settings.py` can affect downstream usage and automation.
- **Treat deployment and CI files as controlled assets.** Helm and Jenkins files appear to be standardized delivery templates; incorrect changes can break packaging, deployment, or CI/CD flows.
- **Avoid committing runtime artifacts.** Local caches, compiled Python files, generated reports, and other temporary outputs should be excluded from source control or cleaned regularly.
  
## 7. Security & Networking (HTTP / HTTPS)

- HTTP support is available out of the box.
- For secure deployments, customers are expected to enable and configure TLS/HTTPS after creating the template repository under Helm charts.
- While HTTP is supported, we strongly recommend using HTTPS for all production deployments.
